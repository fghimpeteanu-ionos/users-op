# user-op
This is a simple example of a Kubernetes operator written in Go. The sole purpose of this operator is
to add a user in a Database table called `users`

## Description
The milestones of this project are:
- [x] Create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the user in order to create CRs (e.g. User CR)
- [ ] Create a database table called `users` in a PostGreSQL database. The database should be installed via Helm.
- [ ] Add logic in the controller to add a user in the `users` table when a User CR is created
- [ ] Deploy the controller to a Kubernetes cluster and integrate it with the local database.
- [ ] Add a second controller that will take care of creating a PostgresSQL Database

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/user-op:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/user-op:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the DB helm chart
```sh
make install-db
````

2. Connect to the DB
```sh
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/my-db-postgresql 25432:5432
# authenticate with postgres user
PGPASSWORD=pg-pretest psql --host 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d user-db -p 25432
```

3. Install the CRDs into the cluster:
```sh
make install
```

4. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

5. Create a User CR:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/user.yaml 
```

6. List resourceds
```sh
watch "kubectl get all,configmap,secrets,pv,pvc"
```

7. Cleanup
```sh
# uninstall PostgreSQL
make uninstall-db

# Remove the PVC and PV created for the PostgreSQL
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
